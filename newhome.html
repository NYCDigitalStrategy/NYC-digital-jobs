          <div class="panel-body"><p><h4>The initiatives that you will work on all share the common goal of delivering more effective services and helping residents address poverty-related challenges. We operate a portfolio of digital tools and offer our expertise across multiple areas, including facilitating data integration to improve social service performance, easing access to services and programs, and designing new digital and in-person services with agency partners.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Data Integration</b> </p>
Add line about data integration
Digital Tool: Worker Connect, a data sharing technology that allows caseworkers to see real-time information about clients drawn from multiple City sources. Users only access information that they have been authorized to view based on their role and all applicable laws and regulations.
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Service Design</b></p> 
Our Service Design work develops solutions rooted in insights about the holistic experiences of those affected by public services. It considers people, processes, communications, and technology as part of the solution. By applying Service Design methodologies, our team better meets the needs of residents and service providers with approaches that produce better results.
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Access  to Services</b></p> 
Our Access to Services work includes digital tools and policy expertise across programs. We seek to make information and enrollment in services available to New Yorkers easy to find and use on any device. Our key digital tool for access to services is  ACCESS NYC, a website that allows New Yorkers to screen for eligibility for over 30 City, State, and Federal benefit programs. Depending on the benefit, residents can apply online, print out pre-populated application forms, and determine agency locations where they can go to directly apply for services. We are currently working on a new mobile-first design and a data platform to power benefits access.
